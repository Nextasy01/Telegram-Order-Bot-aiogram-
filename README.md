# Telegram-Order-Bot-aiogram-
My first pet project written on Python using aiogram library for creating asynchronous telegram bot. It is still under development and in testing mode.
For DB used sqlite3. Also used csv for storing temporary data, I will replace it with JSON though. 
Deployed on Heroku. All orders are posted on telegram channel(https://t.me/tempfortemp).
